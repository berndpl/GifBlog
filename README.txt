:: ANIMATION FLOOR 0.3 (091226)
to implement my blog (blog.plontsch.de) i created a simple animated gif gallery system. Get the code, fork it, extend it, use it. Have fun. Just remember to credit me.

SYSTEM FEATURES
* content limited to images and audio
* easy publishing by renaming + uploading image or audio 
* date + title are directly parsed from image filenames
* an audiofile of similar filename is attached to a existing image post
* quad2gif.sh skript to batch create animated gifs
* RSS feed
* pagination

FUTURE WISHLIST
* ÒI like thisÓ function
* possibilty to link single images
* preloader image

HOW TO?
* To take the photos I use the and the amazing quadcamera iphone app.
* to bulk convert quadcamera jpgs to to animated gifs I use the QUAD2GIF bash skript (placing Òquad2gif.shÓ into a folder with unprocessed images and running it in the terminal).
* to post a photo, you just upload it to the pub/ directory and rename the new files according to the scheme: Ò090813_nicetitle.gifÓ Ð this will put an image with the timemark Ò13.08.09Ó and the title ÒnicetitleÓ.

ADDITIONAL CREDITS
* jQuery + Plug-Ins: JPlayer
* Imagemagick

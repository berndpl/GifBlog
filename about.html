<h2>WHAT IS ANIMATION FLOOR?</h2>

<p>it's meant to be a simple photo-blog system for animated gifs. one page, showing a bunch of GIFs in a chronological order with title-overlays. that's it.</p>


<h2>HOW DO YOU MAKE THESE ANIMATIONS?</h2>

<p>all photos are taken with an iphone and the amazing quadcamera app. to bulk convert quadcamera jpgs to to animated gifs I use my QUAD2GIF skript (/quad2gif.sh). however, for single conversions you could also use <a href="http://labs.artandmobile.com/quadanimator/">quadanimator</a>.
</p>

<h2>HOW DOES IT WORK?</h2>
<p>                                 
in order to post a photo, you just upload it to the pub/ directory and .... well, that's it. there is no backend, database or cms. just PHP and IMAGEMAGICK. the only thing to remember is to name your files according to the scheme: "<strong>090813_nicetitle.gif</strong>" - this will put an image with the timemark "13.08.09" and the title "nicetitle" on your ANIMATION FLOOR. if you don't want any title use the keyword "blank", e.g. "090813_blank.gif". there is even a converterscript for new photos, so you don't have to neccessarily use the quadanimator.
</p>
                                                                                                                                   
                                                      
<h1>:: QUAD2GIF 0.1</h1>
a unix script for bulk of quadcamera image to animated gif conversion


<h2>WHAT IS IT?</h2>                
<p>
it's a simple unix batch script to convert folders full of quadcamera images into animated gifs with one command. to run it you need imagemagick installed on your system, it will do the imageprocessing part. on mac os x you can get it with the darwin ports (it's a repository of unix ports for mac os x. great stuff.). put it into the folder with you quadcamera images locally or on your server and run it by typing "./quad2gif". have fun!
